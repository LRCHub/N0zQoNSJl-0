See the man in the bookshop
See his withered hand
He walks very slowly
Never stands in crowds

Children stand in wonder
As he turns and walks away
Closely guards the secret
Of the fury in his eyes

He's the man with the midas touch (*)
He'll make you burn with just one look
He's the man with the midas touch
He's got the fury in his eyes

He looks so innocent
As he shuffles down the street
But he is the holy sentinel
That guards the gates of Hades

To stop the Lord of Darkness
Coming straight from Hell
The bringer of disaster
The one who took the bread

Until the final conflict
He has to walk the earth
To do his master's bidding
And stop the evil force

He waits for Armageddon
The Nazarene will come
Rising from the ashes
Of the fallen one
