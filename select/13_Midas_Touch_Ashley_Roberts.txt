We've been here before
So many times
And boy, the story's always black and white
Now it's hard to find

There's really noone quite like you
I hate the way you make me vulnerable
For just a second, you could have it all
And in a minute, run away

I thought you had the Midas touch again
But all I see is ebony
My friend

Now we're living different lives
But we're just the same
Don't need a notion but a universe
To keep you away

You know me more than anyone
And that's the reason why I'm running for
If time's a healer
Can you give me more?
Because I can't ignore
For all the world I wouldn't stay

I thought you had the Midas touch again
But all I see is ebony
My friend

Take it all but at the crossroads
(Midas touch)
You don't want to say no
(Midas touch)
Cause I want to let it go
(Midas touch)
Oh, oh

Take it all but at the crossroads
You don't want to say no
I don't want to let this go
It's just ebony
My friend

If you see me, boy
Keep on movin'
History
You can't keep repeatin'
Independence is the life I'm living
You're a shadow of a life I'm leaving

I thought you had the Midas touch back then
But all I see is ebony
My friend

Take it all but at the crossroads
You don't want to say no
I don't want to let this go
It's just ebony
My friend

Midas touch
(Oh, oh)
Midas touch
(Oh, oh)
Midas touch
(Oh, oh)

I thought you had the Midas touch again
But all I see is ebony
My friend
